# container-compose
Run docker-compose services as a container.

I was looking for a way to "compose" a docker image or merge multiple docker images into a single one.

Let say I have a docker-compose file with my APP services: database, web service, login, microserviceA, microserviceB ... and I want to execute multiple instances of this as a single container.
